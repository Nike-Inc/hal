# hal

A runtime environment for [Haskell] applications running on [AWS Lambda].

#### Flexible

This library uniquely supports different types of AWS Lambda Handlers for your needs/comfort with advanced Haskell.
Instead of exposing a single function that constructs a Lambda, this library exposes many.

For lambdas that are pure and safe, then `pureRuntime` is ideal.
It accepts a handler with the signature `(FromJSON a, ToJSON b) => a -> b`.
This runtime guarantees that side-effects cannot occur.

For advanced use cases `mRuntimeWithContext` unlocks the full power of Monad Transformers.
It accepts handlers with the signature `(HasLambdaContext r, MonadCatch m, MonadReader r m, MonadIO m, FromJSON event, ToJSON result) =>  (event -> m result)`
This enables users to add caching logic or expose complex environments.

With numerous options in between these two, developers can choose the right balance of flexibility vs simplicity.

#### Performant

Measuring lambda performance is tricky, so investigation and optimization is ongoing.
Current indications show a _warm_ execution overhead of only ~20% more than the official [Rust Runtime] (a much lower level language).

#### Robust

While testing continues, we have executed over 30k test events without error caused by the runtime.
Naive approaches lead to error rates well over 10%.

## Supported Platforms / GHC Versions

We currently support this library under the same environment that [AWS Lambda
supports][lambda-env].

Our [CI] currently targets the latest three [LTS Stackage Versions][stackage],
the latest three minor versions of [GHC] under [Cabal]
(e.g. `8.6.x`, `8.4.x`, and `8.2.x`), and GHC-head / Stackage nightly builds.

If you haven't already, adding `docker: { enable: true }` to your `stack.yaml`
file will ensure that you're building a binary that can run in
[AWS Lambda][lambda-env].

## Quick Start

This quick start assumes you have the following tools installed:

  - [Stack][stack.yaml]
  - [Docker]
  - [aws-cli]

Add `hal` to your [stack.yaml]'s [`extra-deps`] and enable
[Docker] integration so that your binary is automatically compiled in a
compatible environment for AWS. Also add `hal` to your project's
dependency list (either `project-name.cabal` or `package.yaml`)

```yaml
#...
packages:
  - '.'
  - hal-0.1.0
# ...
docker:
  enable: true
# ...
```

Then, define your types and handler:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE NamedFieldPuns #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

module Main where

import AWS.Lambda.Runtime (pureRuntime)
import Data.Aeson (FromJSON, ToJSON)
import GHC.Generics (Generic)

data Request = Request {
  input :: String
} deriving (Generic)

instance FromJSON Request

data Response = Response {
  output :: String
} deriving (Generic)

instance ToJSON Response

idHandler :: Request -> Response
idHandler Request { input } = Response { output = input }

main :: IO ()
main = pureRuntime idHandler
```

Don't forget to define your [CloudFormation] stack:

```yaml
# file: template.yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
Description: Test for the Haskell Runtime.
Resources:
  HelloWorldApp:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: NOT_USED
      Runtime: provided
      CodeUri: .stack-work/docker/_home/.local/bin/
      Description: My Haskell runtime.
      MemorySize: 128
      Timeout: 3
```

Finally, build, upload and test your lambda!

```bash
# Build the binary, make sure your executable is named `bootstrap`
stack build --copy-bins

# Create your function package
aws cloudformation package \
  --template-file template.yaml
  --s3-bucket your-existing-bucket > \
  deployment_stack.yaml

# Deploy your function
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name "hello-world-haskell" \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --template-file deployment_stack.yaml

# Take it for a spin!
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name your-function-name \
  --region us-west-2
  --payload '{"input": "foo"}'
  output.txt
```
