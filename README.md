# hal

A runtime environment for [Haskell] applications running on [AWS Lambda].

#### Flexible

This library uniquely supports different types of AWS Lambda Handlers for your needs/comfort with advanced Haskell.
Instead of exposing a single function that constructs a Lambda, this library exposes many.

For lambdas that are pure and safe, then `pureRuntime` is ideal.
It accepts a handler with the signature `(FromJSON a, ToJSON b) => a -> b`.
This runtime guarantees that side-effects cannot occur.

For advanced use cases `mRuntime` unlocks the full power of Monad Transformers.
It accepts handlers with the signature `(MonadCatch m, MonadIO m, FromJSON event, ToJSON result) =>  (event -> m result)`
This enables users to add caching logic or expose complex environments.

With numerous options in between these two, developers can choose the right balance of flexibility vs simplicity.

#### Performant

Measuring lambda performance is tricky, so investigation and optimization is ongoing.
Current indications show a _warm_ execution overhead of only ~20% more than the official [Rust Runtime] (a much lower level language).

#### Robust

While testing continues, we have executed over 30k test events without error caused by the runtime.
Naive approaches lead to error rates well over 10%.

## Supported Platforms / GHC Versions

We currently support this library under the same environment that [AWS Lambda
supports][lambda-env].

Our [CI] currently targets the latest three [LTS Stackage Versions][stackage],
the latest three minor versions of [GHC] under [Cabal]
(e.g. `8.6.x`, `8.4.x`, and `8.2.x`), and GHC-head / Stackage nightly builds.

If you haven't already, adding `docker: { enable: true }` to your `stack.yaml`
file will ensure that you're building a binary that can run in
[AWS Lambda][lambda-env].

## Quick Start

This quick start assumes you have the following tools installed:

  - [Stack][stack.yaml]
  - [Docker]
  - [aws-cli]

Add `hal` to your [stack.yaml]'s [`extra-deps`] and enable
[Docker] integration so that your binary is automatically compiled in a
compatible environment for AWS. Also add `hal` to your project's
dependency list (either `project-name.cabal` or `package.yaml`)

```yaml
#...
packages:
  - '.'
  - hal-0.1.2
# ...
docker:
  enable: true
# ...
```

Then, define your types and handler:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric  #-}
{-# LANGUAGE NamedFieldPuns #-}

module Main where

import AWS.Lambda.Runtime (pureRuntime)
import Data.Aeson         (FromJSON, ToJSON)
import GHC.Generics       (Generic)

data IdEvent  = IdEvent { input   :: String } deriving Generic
instance FromJSON IdEvent

data IdResult = IdResult { output :: String } deriving Generic
instance ToJSON IdResult

handler :: IdEvent -> IdResult
handler IdEvent { input } = IdResult { output = input }

main :: IO ()
main = pureRuntime handler
```

Your binary should be called `bootstrap` in order for the custom runtime
to execute properly:

```yaml
# Example snippet of package.yaml
# ...
executables:
  bootstrap:
    source-dirs: src
    main: Main.hs  # e.g. {project root}/src/Main.hs
# ...
```

You'll need to either build on a compatible linux host or inside a compatible docker container (or some other mechanism like nix).
Note that current Stack LTS images are _not_ compatible.
If you see an error message that contains "version 'GLIBC_X.XX' not found" when running (hosted or locally), then your build environment is not compatible.

Enable stack's docker integration and define an optional image within stack.yaml:

```yaml
# file: stack.yaml
docker:
  enabled: true
  # If omitted, this defaults to fpco/stack-build:lts-${YOUR_LTS_VERSION}
  image: ${BUILD_IMAGE}
```

Don't forget to define your [CloudFormation] stack:

```yaml
# file: template.yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
Description: Test for the Haskell Runtime.
Resources:
  HelloWorldApp:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: NOT_USED
      Runtime: provided
      # CodeUri is a relative path from the directory that this CloudFormation
      # file is defined.
      CodeUri: .stack-work/docker/_home/.local/bin/
      Description: My Haskell runtime.
      MemorySize: 128
      Timeout: 3
```

Finally, build, upload and test your lambda!

```bash
# Build the binary, make sure your executable is named `bootstrap`
stack build --copy-bins

# Create your function package
aws cloudformation package \
  --template-file template.yaml
  --s3-bucket your-existing-bucket > \
  deployment_stack.yaml

# Deploy your function
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name "hello-world-haskell" \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --template-file deployment_stack.yaml

# Take it for a spin!
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name your-function-name \
  --region us-west-2
  --payload '{"input": "foo"}'
  output.txt
```

## Local Testing

### Dependencies

  - [Stack][stack.yaml]
  - [Docker]

### Build

```bash
docker pull fpco/stack-build:lts-{version} # First build only, find the latest version in stack.yaml
stack build --copy-bins
```

### Execute w/ Docker

```bash
echo '{ "accountId": "byebye" }' | docker run -i --rm \
    -e DOCKER_LAMBDA_USE_STDIN=1 \
    -v ${PWD}/.stack-work/docker/_home/.local/bin/:/var/task \
    lambci/lambda:provided
```

### Execute w/ SAM Local

Note that hal currently only supports [aws-sam-cli] on versions <1.0.

```bash
echo '{ "accountId": "byebye" }' | sam local invoke --region us-east-1
